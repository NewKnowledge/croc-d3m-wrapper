If ``iterations`` is ``None``,\nthen there is no limit on how many iterations the primitive should do and primitive should\nchoose the best amount of iterations on its own (potentially controlled through\nhyper-parameters). If ``iterations`` is a number, a primitive has to do those number of\niterations (even if not reasonable), if possible. ``timeout`` should still be respected\nand potentially less iterations can be done because of that.

See `pickle`,\n`copy`, and `copyreg` Python modules for more information.\n\nIn this context we use term method arguments to mean both formal parameters and\nactual parameters of a method. We do this to not confuse method parameters with\nprimitive parameters (``Params``).\n\nAll arguments to all methods are keyword-only. No ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` should\never be used in any method.\n\nStandardized interface use few public attributes and no other public attributes are\nallowed to assure future compatibility. For your attributes use the convention that\nprivate symbols should start with ``_``.\n\nPrimitives can have methods which are not part of standardized interface classes:\n\n* Additional \"produce\" methods which are prefixed with ``produce_`` and have\n  the same semantics as ``produce`` but potentially return different output\n  container types instead of ``Outputs`` (in such primitive ``Outputs`` is seen as\n  primary output type, but the primitive also has secondary output types).\n  They should return ``CallResult`` and have ``timeout`` and ``iterations`` arguments.\n* Private methods prefixed with ``_``.\n\nNo other public additional methods are allowed. If this represents a problem for you,\nopen an issue. (The rationale is that for other methods an automatic system will not\nunderstand the semantics of the method.)\n\nMethod arguments which start with ``_`` are seen as private and can be used for arguments\nuseful for debugging and testing, but they should not be used by (or even known to) a\ncaller during normal execution. Such arguments have to be optional (have a default value)\nso that the method can be called without the knowledge of the argument.\n\nAll arguments to all methods and all hyper-parameters together are seen as arguments to\nthe primitive as a whole. They are identified by their names. This means that any argument\nname must have the same type and semantics across all methods, effectively be the same argument.\nIf a method argument matches in name a hyper-parameter, it has to match it in type and semantics\nas well. Such method argument overrides a hyper-parameter for a method call. All this is necessary\nso that callers can have easier time determine what values to pass to arguments and that it is\neasier to describe what all values are inputs to a primitive as a whole (set of all\narguments).\n\nTo recap, subclasses can extend arguments of standard methods with explicit typed keyword\narguments used for the method call, or define new \"produce\" methods with arbitrary explicit\ntyped keyword arguments. There are multiple kinds of such arguments allowed:\n\n* An (additional) input argument of any container type and not necessary of ``Inputs``\n  (in such primitive ``Inputs`` is seen as primary input type, but the primitive also has\n  secondary input types).\n* An argument which is overriding a hyper-parameter for the duration of the call.\n  It should match a hyper-parameter in name and type. It should be a required argument\n  (no default value) which the caller has to supply (or with a default value of a\n  hyper-parameter, or with the same hyper-parameter as it was passed to the constructor,\n  or with some other value). This is meant just for fine-control by a caller during fitting\n  or producing, e.g., for a threshold or learning rate, and is not reasonable for most\n  hyper-parameters.\n* An (additional) value argument which is one of standard data types, but not a container type.\n  In this case a caller will try to satisfy the input by creating part of a pipeline which\n  ends with a primitive with singleton produce method and extract the singleton value and\n  pass it without a container. This kind of an argument is **discouraged** and should probably\n  be a hyper-parameter instead (because it is unclear how can a caller determine which value\n  is a reasonable value to pass in an automatic way), but it is defined for completeness and\n  so that existing pipelines can be easier described.\n* A private argument prefixed with ``_`` which is used for debugging and testing.\n  It should not be used by (or even known to) a caller during normal execution.\n  Such argument has to be optional (have a default value) so that the method can be called\n  without the knowledge of the argument.\n\nEach primitive's class automatically gets an instance of Python's logging logger stored\ninto its ``logger`` class attribute. The instance is made under the name of primitive's\n``python_path`` metadata value. Primitives can use this logger to log information at\nvarious levels (debug, warning, error) and even associate extra data with log record\nusing the ``extra`` argument to the logger calls.\n\nSubclasses of this class allow functional compositionality.\n\nAttributes\n----------\nmetadata : PrimitiveMetadata\n    Primitive's metadata.
